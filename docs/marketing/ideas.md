## Story Templates

### Idea 001: SSH blocked at coffee shop

**Hook:** The universal pain of corporate/public WiFi blocking SSH

**Scene 1: The Problem**
- Start: Developer at coffee shop, laptop open, frustrated expression, screen showing "Connection refused" or terminal with error
- End: Same dev, even more frustrated, maybe head in hands
- Transition: Frustration builds, maybe tries again, fails again

**Scene 2: The Discovery**
- Start: Dev pauses, remembers something, reaches for phone
- End: Dev holding phone, screen glowing with terminal interface
- Transition: "Wait... I have MidTerm" moment

**Scene 3: The Relief**
- Start: Dev looking at phone showing MidTerm with active terminal
- End: Dev smiling, leaning back satisfied, coffee in hand
- Transition: Relief washes over, takes sip of coffee

**Tweet:**
> SSH blocked at the coffee shop. Again.
>
> HTTP? Never blocked.
>
> MidTerm: Your terminal, anywhere.

### Idea 002: Claude Code overnight check

**Hook:** The 3am "is it done yet?" anxiety

**Scene 1: The Setup**
- Start: Developer at desk, evening, Claude Code running on screen
- End: Same dev, yawning, looking at clock showing late hour
- Transition: Gets tired, decides to go to bed

**Scene 2: The Check**
- Start: Dark bedroom, person in bed, reaches for phone on nightstand
- End: Phone screen illuminates face, showing terminal
- Transition: Quick check, bleary eyes focus on screen

**Scene 3: The Peace**
- Start: Dev looking at phone, terminal shows progress/completion
- End: Dev puts phone down, peaceful expression, goes back to sleep
- Transition: Satisfied nod, closes eyes

**Tweet:**
> Claude Code is 87% through the refactor.
>
> Checked from bed. At 3am. Like a normal person.
>
> MidTerm: Because AI agents don't care what time it is.

## Prompting Tips

### For consistent characters across scenes:
- Be specific about appearance: "young professional with short dark hair and glasses"
- Mention clothing: "wearing a blue hoodie"
- Reference environment: "modern coffee shop with exposed brick"

### For good transitions:
- Describe the motion: "smoothly picks up phone from table"
- Describe emotional change: "expression shifts from frustration to curiosity"
- Keep camera angle consistent when possible

### Aspect ratios:
- `9:16` — TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts (vertical)
- `16:9` — YouTube, LinkedIn (horizontal)
- `1:1` — Twitter, Instagram feed (square)
